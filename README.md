= Note =

This plugin does NOT manage "unattached" images in the Media Library. WordPress already provides built-in filtering for unattached media. This plugin focuses specifically on finding physical files that WordPress doesn't know about at all.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `cleanup-orphan-images` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to Media > Cleanup Orphan Images

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are orphan files? =

Orphan files are physical media files in your uploads folder that exist on the server but are not registered in the WordPress database.

= Is it safe to delete orphan files? =

Review the list before deletion. Some files may still be used by themes or plugins that reference them directly by URL. Always back up your uploads folder first.

= Can I recover deleted files? =

No, deletion is permanent. Back up your site first.
